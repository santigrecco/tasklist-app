# Backend tasklist app

## Important

**If you want to run the application without docker, you should have an instance of mongodb running on port 27017 (you can use the docker-compose.yml image that is defined inside the `mongo-db` folder), also should change the `MONGODB_URI` variable in `.env` file , as indicated in the same file.**

In the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

to serve the application in development mode

or run:

### `npm run serve`

to run the application with nodemon (reloads the app if there is any edit)
